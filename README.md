# Todo Client - A Private Todo Client

A simple frontend component for a Todo application.

See [Todo-Server](https://github.com/balbyu/todo) for backend component

The goal of this project was to develop the frontend portion of a todo application with a couple of friends, rather than following some tutorial. Things to note about this code vs. what you might find in tutorials:

* Uses promise based HTTP client (axios) to make requests
* Manages entire application state of Users/Todos using Redux
* Uses JSON Web Tokens to authenticate client over multiple sessions
* Uses React-Router for route handling


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`
